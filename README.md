# 3D Animated Text Button Generator

## Description

This project is a simple web application that allows users to generate a text button with 3D animations for different interaction states (idle, hover, click). It's built using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

The goal is to provide a visually engaging button that can be easily customized with user-defined text.

## Features

*   **Custom Text:** Users can input any text for the button.
*   **3D Appearance:** The button has a distinct 3D look achieved with CSS transforms and shadows.
*   **Idle Animation:** A subtle animation plays when the button is just being viewed, making it feel alive.
*   **Hover Animation:** The button reacts when the mouse hovers over it, typically by lifting, scaling, and changing its shadow.
*   **Click Animation:** A responsive animation plays when the button is clicked, providing clear visual feedback.

## File Structure

*   `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the web page, including the text input field and the container for the 3D button.
*   `style.css`: The CSS file that styles the page and defines the 3D appearance and animations for the button.
*   `script.js`: The JavaScript file that handles user input, dynamically generates the button, and applies the necessary CSS classes.

## How to Use

1.  Clone or download the repository.
2.  Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3.  Type your desired button text into the input field.
4.  Click the "Create Button" button (or press Enter in the input field).
5.  Your 3D animated button will appear below. Hover over it and click it to see the animations.
